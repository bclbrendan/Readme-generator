# Readme-generator
## Description
Generates readme files from user inputs using Node.js. This helps me create a readme file based on plain text inputs without having to remember all the notation regarding. 

While building this app, I learned a lot of new things with node, along with getting practice with loading packages jsons and using the inquirer package.

## Installation

Node needs to be installed via command line 
run  - npm init package.json 


## Video of usage

See my video  [here](Readme_demo_video.webm)

## Credits

I received some advice from my TA Alameen on how to utilise inquirer.
